# This file contains all configuration data for channels
# The formating for them remains in the Towny Config and world files
# so they can still be used on a per world basis.

# Channels are toggleable using any of the commands listed
# eg. /tc (would put you in town chat)
#          doing it again would take you out
#          So long as you had the permission node for that channel.

# The channel type is either GLOBAL, TOWN, NATION or DEFAULT.
#  These specify what chat formating section they will use
#  and where the chat will go
# (town goes to all town residents, depending on the range setting)

# channeltag is applied if the chat format for that channel has the {channelTag}

# messagecolour sets the colour of the message when sent.

# range is a setting which allows greater control over each channel.
# this will set the maximum distance between players who can hear the message.
# range is in blocks (if set to a limit).
#
#     -1 = no limits
#	  0 = same world only
#	  any positive value = limited range in the same world.

# Text colouring
# --------------
# Black = &0, Navy = &1, Green = &2, Blue = &3, Red = &4
# Purple = &5, Gold = &6, LightGray = &7, Gray = &8
# DarkPurple = &9, LightGreen = &a, LightBlue = &b
# Rose = &c, LightPurple = &d, Yellow = &e, White = &f
